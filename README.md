# Festival Events Manager

Festival Events Manager is a web-based app which generates a public festival events programme by enabling festival organisers to store their events information in one central database.

### Why this product is needed:

Festivals are often organised by several people each working independently on their own section of the festival. For example, in the case of a folk festival, one person plans the concerts, another the workshops, another the ceilidhs/dances, another the dance display teams, another the children/family events.  

But they are all working to produce one single events programme for the whole festival.  Sometimes collaboration between several people working independently on the same task needs some help.

#### Festival Manager helps in two main ways:

1. Enables event organisers to collaboratively create one central source of events information:

The Festival Events Manager enables each organiser to enter their events into one central database, viewable by all organisers. 

This allows for much easier version control as there is only one central version of the events programme, and avoids confusion about which information is most up to date (for example, information previously only contained in emails or spreadsheets).

It enables all the organisers to see each other's intended events during the planning process and therefore helps avoid venue clashes or double booking of performers. 

2. Generating a public events programme:

The Festival Events Manager then takes the data entered by the organisers and, as each event is set to public by the organisers, displays a web-based festival events programme viewable by the public.  

When changes need to be made (for example, if a performer calls in sick during the festival and needs to be replaced), this means that the programme can be instantly updated, and in one place only, without needing to make amendments in several different versions of the programme (organisers' planning documents, information sent to performers and crew, public website, etc).

### Users of the product

#### Staff users: 

The festival organisers. These people are usually volunteers and not necessarily highly proficient in using tech solutions. They need an interface that is quick and intuitive to use, without having to make great efforts to learn to use it.

#### Public users: 

Members of the general public. More specifically, this includes:

* People deciding if they want to attend the festival, and on which days if they're not coming for the whole thing

* People who have already decided to go, to make plans ahead of the festival and make a note of which events they definitely don't want to miss

* Festival attendees during the festival, to view the programme to see what's on when and where, and decide which event to go to next.
